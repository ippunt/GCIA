May be UDP or TCP
DNS header begins after 8 byte UDP Header. 
Replies directly for responsible server is Authoritive. Like you local DNS would be authoritive for your domain. Intermediate non-authoritive
Extended DNS Additional recordds > 0, may be nonqueried DNS results or DNSSec

Record types - A record 32 bit, AAAA 128 bit IP address. 
Cname -  canonical name - alias for name
MX - mail exchange record
NS - Name server record
PTR - Pointer is receverse lookup
SOA - Start of Authority Authority information about zone

Zone transfer - Query may show AXFR mydomain.local    Large answeres or transfers are generally TCP. These are truncated

TTL - Is set at authoritive server and states how long other DNS servers should hold on to answer.

Truncated - C is client S is server

CUDP -> SUDP Query 1 question
SUDP -> CUDP Answer 1 question Truncated bit set
