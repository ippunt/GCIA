May be UDP or TCP
UDP DNS without EDNS max size is 512 bytes. If response is 513 bytes it must be sent by TCP
DNS header begins after 8 byte UDP Header. 
Replies directly for responsible server is Authoritive. Like you local DNS would be authoritive for your domain. Intermediate non-authoritive
Extended DNS Additional recordds > 0, may be nonqueried DNS results or DNSSec
All dns packets get DF
nslookup -debug hostname.query.com; Lots of data
Record types - A record 32 bit, AAAA 128 bit IP address. 
Cname -  canonical name - alias for name
MX - mail exchange record
NS - Name server record
PTR - Pointer is receverse lookup
SOA - Start of Authority Authority information about zone

Zone transfer - Query may show AXFR mydomain.local    Large answeres or transfers are generally TCP. These are truncated

TCPdump output I believe -

TTL - Is set at authoritive server and states how long other DNS servers should hold on to answer.

Truncated - C is client S is server
Below happends as sequence: 
CUDP -> SUDP Query 1 question
SUDP -> CUDP Answer 1 question Truncated bit set
[S][S.][.] 3 way handshake CTCP -> STCP 1 qestion

FastFlux - DNS resolutions quickly changes with short TTL. Double FF hostnames and resolutions change. 

Dependancies- Response needs Correct IPs, ports, and Query ID.

Poisoning - 
You could send a query w/ authority and poison the servers answers. That is no longer an option. But there are still methods. 
  bailwich checkins is what prevents this. 
  
DNSSec
Ensure integrity and authenticity. If you want confidentiality utilize DOH or DOT.
DNSSec utilizes public key cryptography to digitally sign responses. 
Introduces new DNS resource records:
  RRSIG- Signature for a resource record. Hash of record.
  DNSKEY- Public key for DNS zone.
  DS - Signing key of a delegate zone.
  NSEC - proof that the name does not exist. NSec gives you the next signed record for integrity and authenticity. 
DNSSec supported - field z will be a 1, not supported 0.
