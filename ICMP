Header 8 bytes, IPv4 protocol #1, IPv6 protocol #58
Checksum only ICMP header proto 1, Proto 58 psuedo-H checksum. Includes IP header.
Error messages contain embedded packet, no -v may display error.
reply src & dst is reversed , type 0, payload identical, only windows changes code field.
ID may sequence per dst host, sequence should be per ping.
ID is always same Windows 10, seq is only identifier.
Windows payload icmp[8:32] = 0x61,62,63,69,6a..6f,70..77,61..69    icmp[39] == 0x69, THis is validation in WS
Linux payload icmp[24:40] = 0x10 ..0x37
icmp[0] ==8 and icmp[1] ==0; Echo request
Windows Tracert sends 3 ICMP, Linux sends 3 udp port 334434- 33534


Error rules:
  No error to: an error, dst b-cast, src b-cast or lookback, any frag unless 0 offset. 
  Bad checksum. Error must send original IP header + 8 bytes so protocol header. 
  
  Recon:
    host unreachable - Network exists
    port unreachable - host exists and alive
    error message may be the whole point!
    
  Queries:
  tcpdump will not output info on embedded file
  tsharl will output based on embedded file info
  
  tcpdump -r 1.pcap 'icmp[0] = 8 and not icmp[8:4] = 0x61626364'; ICMP that is not windows.
