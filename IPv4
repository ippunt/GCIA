1. Stuff about IP
2. Stuff about frags

1.
Ip Header min length 20 bytes, Max 60 bytes
IP < 46 bytes packet is a runt and requires padding by the NIC.
Checksum recomputed for each hop along the way. IP header only.
TCP and UDP additionally use IP header in their checksum creating psuedo header
ICMP no psuedo header, IPv6 ICMP psuedo header. IPv6 no checksum on header.
IHL 4 bits, 1111, 0xf, =15*4= 60 bytes. Internet Header Length. Smallest value is 5, 20 byte minimum. 0x5
If you receive a packet and unable to validate IP version, Silent discard. Basically drop. Or Invalid version drop. 
Options will start right after IP header byte 19 if there are any.
Uniquie identifer Checksum, IP ID but the IP ID will be the same on a full packet and a packet and its fragements. That is how you know frags.
Max Datagramsize 65,535


2. 
offset 0 gets full application header TCP or ICMP. Packet 1 offset is 0
  all frags get IP header w/offset and timestamp changed  
  only first packet can be recognized for protocol
  cannot traverse over the internet, Can't NAT IP header without TCP/UDP header. 
  
[IP][TCP][Data]                           [IP][Data]                                                 [IP][Data]
Packet 1, offset 0, MF=1                 Packet 2, offset 1460, MF=1                                 Packet 3, offset 2920, MF=0   
offset 0 w/ mf obviously first one       All frags same offset except last may be unique

Router will fragment is MTU is exceeded.
Generally happends due to hiding malware, or a misconfiguration

The IP ID is the same for all fragments. 
The offset is multiplied by 8 due to 3 missing bits needed for max size. 
You lose a little bit of accuracy as offset count minimum difference is 8 bits. 
The offset gets 2 bytes in IP header. They are bytes 6 & 7 starting at 0.
