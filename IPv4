Ip Header min length 20 bytes, Max 60 bytes
IP < 46 bytes packet is a runt and requires padding by the NIC.
Checksum recomputed for each hop along the way. IP header only.
TCP and UDP additionally use IP header in their checksum creating psuedo header
ICMP no psuedo header, IPv6 ICMP psuedo header. IPv6 no checksum on header.
IHL 4 bits, 1111, 0xf, =15*4= 60 bytes. Internet Header Length. Smallest value is 5, 20 byte minimum. 0x5
If you receive a packet and unable to validate IP version, Silent discard. Basically drop. Or Invalid version drop. 
Options will start right after IP header byte 19 if there are any.
Uniquie identifer Checksum, IP ID but the IP ID will be the same on a full packet and a packet and its fragements. That is how you know frags.
