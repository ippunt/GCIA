Extension headers - 
Check for extention header IP6[6] = (43)
An extension header is not fragmentable, and must be processed by all nodes.

16 byte address, 128 bit, 8 byte net 8 byte host. 
IPv6 does not fragment. Transmitting node must fragment, routers will not. 
IPv6 is more efficient that IPv4. All hops do not need to do Checksum as there is not one in the header.
