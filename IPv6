16 byte address, 128 bit, 8 byte net 8 byte host. 
IPv6 does not fragment. Transmitting node must fragment, routers will not. 
IPv6 is more efficient than IPv4. All hops do not need to do Checksum as there is not one in the header. Ipv4 recomputes checksum as TTL decreased. 
Fields removed - Fragmentation and flags, checksum, options, IP ID, header length. 
Fields added flow label, 20 bit flow identifier 
  A flow is a sequence of packets that are sent from a particular source to a particular, unicast or multicast, destination. 
  The source also requires special handling by the intervening routers.
Traffic class 1 byte IPv6[0:1]
Traffic will use gobally routable when leaving or coming into a network. 2000::/3
DAD - Duplicate Address Detection Like a gratuitious ARP. NS w/ its own address
NS- Neighbor Solicitation - Goes to all registered devices, multicast
Multicast - (33:33:ff:a7:9a:d5) 33:33 represents multicast, a7:9a:d5 represents channel
RS - 33:33:00:00:00:02 only forwards to members of the group
RA host holds for 1800 seconds, always goes to all hosts ff02::1, ICMPv6 
ND attacks spoof w/ wrong mac DOS, NA w/ different address, RA w/MITM addy. 
RFC 3756, IPV6 NDP Trust models & Threats. 


Next header field tells you header at [IP6]40, Next hdr field is IP6[6]
Extension headers - 
An extension header is not fragmentable, and must be processed by all nodes.

Neighbor Solicitation information- 
If IPv6 device NA, registers with switch, no flood.
show ipv6 nd on-link prefix; displays RA
show ipv6 traffic; useful stats
Devices send a IGMP join request. MLD IPv6 replaces IGMP

Broker- Hurricane electric can be used as free IPv6 Broker

NDP, IGMP, types changed 0-127 error, 128-255 informational
psuedo-header encapsulated the IP header for checksum
provides host on local network like ARP once did. detect change in link local address.

RA Destination- 33:33:00:00:00:01 , ff02::1 going to all nodes. Hey I am a router, Hello!
RA Source-      00:1b:90:2d:bb:bb , fe80::21b6   Router link-local
RS Source-      00:1b:90:2d:bb:bb , fe80::21b6  
RS Dest -       33:33:00:00:00:02 , ff02::2 Going to all routers. Hey I need a router, tell me about you.
