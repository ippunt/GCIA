Parts of the microsoft protocol are NBO big endian BE, parts are little endian LE, and ascii and Unicode. 
BE = aabbcc  LE= ccbbaa     how messages are sent to CPU is the difference between BE and LE.
NBO was established for netowrking protocols but Microsoft... Stands for Network Byte Order
SMB is based on CIFS.

SMB supports file printing, named pipes, serial and other comm devices.

Flow:
Negotiate Dialect - SMB version
Session Setup - Authentication, Kerberos, No domain SAM
Tee Connect  - Access to share

SMB version 3 supports encryption natively but not mandatory.

Message ID - negotiation does not have ID but every request gets an incremented ID.
  negotation 0, setup 1, thereafter 2,3,4,5


Wireshark - 
smb2.msg_id == 1093

Get message id as column
  SMB2 > SMB2Header > Message ID:2 , right click apply as column 
smb.tree == "\\\\fileserver\IPC$"
smb2.tree contains fileserver
smb2.tree matches fileserver
Best not using contains or matches it is iffy
Edit > find packet > RegEx or String  <fileserver>            This worked perfectly!!!!


Messages:
Create - Executed as create or open access something
Read - read from a source
write - write data to a source
IOCTL - Executes a file system or device control across network
