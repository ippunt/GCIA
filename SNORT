1. Be able to help yourslef
2. Always use pcap to test rules
3. Alerts to prompt might not be enough
4. packets and plugin help
5. Unified will log to file with packets
6. Syslog

1.
snort -?, display all options   ->snort -? | grep "\-A"

2. 
snort -c snort.lua -r my.pcap -R my.rules -q -A alert_fast

3. 
snort --help-config alert_fast; Example --lua "alert_fast= {file=true}"

4. 
snort--help-plugins | grep "logger"

5. 
snort -c .snort.lua -r my.pcap -l ./logs -A unified2
u2spewfoo .logs/unified2.log.1612569; Output Alert info + packet
u2boat -t pcap unified2.log.1612569  1612569_alert.pcap
Now you could use zeek, TCP dump, or wireshark on the pcap

6.
Why \n, I really don't know if need to get this to work, do some research. Or rapid testing. 
alert_syslog = { \n facility = 'auth', \n level = 'alert', \n host = 1.1.1.1:514 }
