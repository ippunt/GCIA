1. Client to Server C-Hello, support cipher suite, TLS version 32 bit string nonce. Nonce will be used for session key
2. Server to Client S-Hello, TLS version, selected cipher, certificate, 32 bit nonce. 
3. Client validates fingerpring found in cert, uses nonce with its own to generate premaster secret and send to server
    Both client and server use pre-master secret to generate master secret, which derive session keys to encrypt traffic. Assymetric for sig, Sym for data.
  
4. C<--->S Encrypted Comms. TLS is a 3 way handshake

TLS 1.3 disabled many algos decryption relied on. AUg 2018 fast open begin to be leveraged. 
  Fast-Open subsequent connections rely on previously negotiated key material, coupled with DNS over TLS hard to detect anything.
