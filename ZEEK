Majority of events generated by built-in-function *.bif

1. Quick usage
2. Events. script and signatures ohh my!
3. Quick small example of sig
4. Quick simple output filtering
5. Run traffic across your own signature

1. Quick usage
The 7th line in the conn log tells you fields. Get conn.log UID that looks interesting
zeek -r mysketch.pcap
cat conn.log 
egrep <UIDCetk84378343jrkewrw> *.log;    This would show you all logs associated with connections. 


2. 
A zeek script may be defined as an event.
A zeek signature may create an event.
A signature creates an event, the script called by that event then does something.

You have signatues, scripts and events are text identification. 
A signature may call a script for better analysis before raising the event. 
The only way for a user defined zeek script to be called is to identify a zeek defined event that causes it to trigger it. 

3.
signature sig1 {
header ip[16:1] ==41,62
event "sig1 detect"
} Detecs if the first octet in IP dest is 41 or 62

4.
cat pe.log | zeek-cut -d ts uid; normalize timestamp and print out UID
cat http.log | zeek-cut-d ts id.orig_h id.orig_p id.resp_h

5. zeek -r inbetween.pcap -s windows_banner.sig
cat conn.log | zeek-cut -d ts proto
