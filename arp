Hardware type : Ethernet (1)
Protocol type : IPv4 (0x0800)
hardware size : 6
protocol size : 4
opcode        : 1 is a request
sender Mac    : aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
sender IP     : 1.1.1.1
Target Mac    : ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
target IP     : 2.2.2.2

You have to know IP or DNS which converts to IP to communicate.
Arp resolves IP -> MAC address
opcode 1 is request, 2 is a reply
proto type 4 = ipv4, 

If you receive multiple responses it is likely the first response will go to arp cache. 
Gratuitous will overwrite the cache. 

WS:
Request - arp.opcode ==1, Reply = arp.opcode ==2
Gratuitous is arp.opcode ==1, It is not a reply but it is an answer. Letting you know!
arp.isgratuitous ==1
