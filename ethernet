802.3   minimum frame length is 64 Bytes = 14+46+4     ( Header + Packet + FCS )
A runt is a frame that is smaller than 64 and should be padded with 0s. 
Actually padding should be done by the nic
You can never see 4 byte FCS in wirehsark. 
Vlan  [DSTmac_6B] [SRCmac_6B] [802.1qtag_4B] [payload] [crc]   18 byte header. 

ARP 28 bytes requires padding

IP < 46 Byte is a runt

Ethertypes
0x800 IPv4, 0x8600 IPv6, 0x806 ARP, 0x8100 VLAN

ARP on a trunk -  0x8100 Needs to tag to function. 

MTU generally 1518 eth, IP 1500

Wireshark:
ether src aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
eth.addr aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
eth.dst  ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
ether host aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff; to and from host
01:00:5e is multicast
(eth.dst[0]==01)  multicast or bcast
You can bitmask in wireshark but best to use built in protocol analyzer. Sometimes a little goofy.
frmae contains "admin"
frame contains aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
