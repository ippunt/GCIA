1. tcpdump basics and some switches
2.
Output
3. BPF examples
4. Easy filters

1. tcpdump -r mypcap.pcap -c 1; reads pcap and first packet
so these are kind of special in -r needs file and -c needs number, rest of switches do things to data in pcap or on wire being stored or consoled
-x, -X, -xx, -XX, Show hex, show ASCII and HEX, hex to inclue link layer, ASCII HEX link layer. Capital is ASCII double is link layer data as well.
-A display payload
-C Restricted output file size
-D list Interfaces
-e data link layer
-F read filter expression from file 
-i listen on this interface
-n no dns
-s set snap length in  bytes
-S display aboslute TCP Seq number
-t no timestamp
-tttt print date and time
-v verbose
-w write packets to file

When you read outut 0x0000 indicated firest line and bytes 0-15, 0x0010 indicates second line and bytes 16-

3. Ones preserve, 0 discard

Most Exclusive'tcp[13] = 0x03'; are bits exactly set 
Less Exclusive'tcp[13] & 0x03 = 0x03'; are these bits set exclude others
Least Exlusive'tcp[13] & 0x03 !=0'; is either one set atleast one

Discard lower nibble 'tcp[12] & 0xf0 > 0x50'    DIscard lower nibble compare high
Shift                 'tcp[12]/16 > 5'          divide by 16 treat as low order nibble, I think shift right aswell
Shift                 'tcp[12] >> 4 > 5'        Right shift

4. 
tcpdump -r my.pcap 'tcp dst port 143 and tcp src port 69420'
